## Testing

To run this on your computer:
 * [Download the repository](https://github.com/Robson/Space-Generator/archive/master.zip).
 * Unzip anywhere.
 * Open index.html in your browser.

## File Descriptions

### index.html + style.css

These perform their normal roles: the webpage is responsible for the initial content of the page, whilst the stylesheet handles the formatting/layout.

### page.js

This is all of the JavaScript that generates the space scene.

### background1.png + background2.png

In older versions one of these images was set as the background of the page. The images are almost entirely black with some simulated noise/static. They were removed because the overall aim is to create a webpage that just uses emojis/unicode and not images.
